1. Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.

   Middleware in Express is essentially a series of function calls that get executed 
   in the order they are added. Middleware functions have access to the request object 
   (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s 
   request-response cycle. If a middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, 
   it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. 
   Otherwise, the request will be left hanging. Middleware functions can be used for various tasks 
   such as logging, authentication, or handling errors.

2. What does CRUD stand for?
   
   CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. 
   These are the four basic functions of persistent storage. 
   - Create is used to add new records, 
   - Read is used to fetch existing records, 
   - Update is used to modify existing records, 
   - and Delete is used to remove records.

3. You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
   1. How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
   
    I am using the dotenv package to load the variables from the .env file into process.env. 
    This allows my application to access these variables anywhere in your code. 

   2. How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your Github repository?

   To prevent the .env file from being stored in my Github repository, I add it to my .gitignore file. 
   This tells Git to ignore the file and not track it.
